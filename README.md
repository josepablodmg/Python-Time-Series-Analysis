# Time-Series Analysis with Python

This project introduces **time-series analysis and visualization** using Python. The focus is on **grouping data by seasonal patterns**, exploring trends, and creating clear visualizations to understand temporal dynamics.

## üîπ Project Highlights
- Worked with **time-indexed datasets** to explore patterns over time.  
- Applied **grouping and aggregation** to analyze seasonal trends.  
- Created **visualizations in Python** to highlight patterns, including line plots and seasonal breakdowns.  
- Practiced foundational **time-series concepts**: trend, seasonality, and grouping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis  
- Concepts applied: time-indexed data, grouping, aggregation, plotting
